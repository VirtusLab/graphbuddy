# Graph Buddy playground examples

This subfolder contains examples illustrating the usage of the extension. Each sample is a self-contained project highlighting features of Graph Buddy. You can play with it and learn all the extension goodies.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you follow installation steps from the [official documentation](http://graphbuddy.virtuslab.com/) on how to set up the environment (notably, you will need JVM installed on your computer).

## Getting started

1. Install *Graph Buddy* on your IDE of choice: [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=virtuslab.graph-buddy) or [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13467-graph-buddy)
2. Navigate to the folder with a chosen example.
3. Open Graph Buddy plugin.
4. (optional) Select 'Show full graph' under 'Show graph options'.
5. Browse and instantly see what the project is about with Graph Buddy!

### Notes

After a successful project indexing operation, Graph Buddy will generate `.semanticgraphs` the folder containing all semantic information required by the Graph Buddy. If you wish to start over clean or you find any unexpected errors, delete this folder and re-index your project again.
